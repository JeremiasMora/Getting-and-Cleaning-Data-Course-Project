This repository is based on cleaning the following database: [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones), where we obtained the following files:

* `run_analysis.R` = script where the above database was cleaned.
* `Codebook.md` = explanation of the `run_analysis.R` file.
* `tidydataset.txt` = database obtained by running the `run_analysis.R` file.
